## Setup 

First, I load relevant packages and set global preferences. 

```{r setup, message = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)


knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d

```

## Problem 1

I load the Instacart data from the p8105.datasets using:

```{r instacart}

data("instacart")

```

The dimensions of the instacart data set are `r dim(instacart)`, with `r length(t(instacart))` observations, and the variables in this data set are: `r names(instacart)`

Number of aisles (134) and those most ordered from (fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packages vegetables and fruits, yogurt, and cheese being the five most popular) are found with the code below, and I also make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered, derived from the products ordered per aise and arranged by magnitude.

```{r instacart_not_inline}

n_aisles = 
  instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

head(n_aisles, 10)

nrow(n_aisles)

insta_plot1 = n_aisles %>%  
  filter(
   n > 10000)  %>%  
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
           geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
           labs(
             title = "Number of items ordered per aisle",
             x = "aisle",
             y = "number of orders") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 65, hjust = 1))
         
  insta_plot1
  
  ggsave("instacart_plot1_aisles.pdf", insta_plot1, width = 8, height = 5)
  
```

The top few aisles are the most popular by far, with fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged vegetables fruits, and yogurt again being shown to have the highest number of orders. 

Next, I make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients,” “dog food care,” and “packaged vegetables fruits," and I include the number of times each item is ordered in my table under the `n` variable. 

```{r instacart_aisles}

insta_table = 
  instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle == c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>%  
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n)),
         product_name = tolower(product_name)) %>% 
  filter(rank <= 3)  %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank)
knitr::kable(insta_table, caption = "*Most popular items in three aisles*")

```

Next, I make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week, using `pivot_wider` to make it a 2x7 table. 

```{r instacart_apple_coffee_hour, message = FALSE}

insta_table2 = 
  instacart %>% 
  mutate(product_name = tolower(product_name),
         order_dow = recode(order_dow, "0" = "sunday", "1" = "monday", "2" = "tuesday", "3" = "wednesday", "4" = "thursday", "5" = "friday", "6" = "saturday")) %>%
  filter(product_name == c("pink lady apples", "coffee ice cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%  
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = order_dow, 
              values_from = mean_hour) 
knitr::kable(insta_table2, digits = 3,
             caption = "*Mean hour Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day*")

```

## Problem 2

This problem uses the BRFSS data, loaded from the `p8105.datasets` package.

I clean by: 

- formatting the data to use appropriate variable names
- focusing on the “Overall Health” topic
- include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
- organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”

```{r brfss, message = FALSE}

data("brfss_smart2010")

brfss = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health", 
         response %in% c("Excellent", "Very Good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very Good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor") )) %>%
  arrange(response) %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr) %>% 
  select(-c(data_value_footnote, data_value_footnote_symbol, location_id)) %>% 
  drop_na()

```

The following code tells us which states were observed at 7 or more locations in 2002, then 2010: 

```{r brfss_years, message = FALSE}
brfss_2002 = 
  brfss %>% 
  filter(year == "2002") %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  count(state) %>%
  filter(n >= 7)
knitr::kable(brfss_2002,
             caption = "*States observed at 7 or more locations, 2002*")
brfss_2010 = 
  brfss %>% 
  filter(year == "2010") %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  count(state) %>%
  filter(n >= 7)
knitr::kable(brfss_2010,
             caption = "*States observed at 7 or more locations, 2010*")

```

Next, I construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, containing, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value across locations within a state.

I then make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state.

```{r brfss_spaghetti, message = FALSE}

brfss_excellent = 
  brfss %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(state, year) %>%
  summarize(mean_dv = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE))

brfss_excellent_spaghetti = 
  ggplot(brfss_excellent, aes(x = year,
                              y = mean_dv,
                              color = state)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.3, aes(group = state, color = state)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, aes(group = state, color = state)) +
  labs(x = "year", 
       y = "observations in each state", 
       title = "Observations by stage between 2002 and 2010") +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
  
brfss_excellent_spaghetti

ggsave("brfss_plot1_spaghetti.pdf", brfss_excellent_spaghetti, width = 8, height = 5)

```

There is no general trend for this data, but there are generally more than ten observations for each state, with no single state standing apart from the data as an outlier. 

I now make a two-panel bar graph for the years 2006 and 2010 showing the distribution of the variable data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State.

```{r brfss_2_panel, message = FALSE}

brfss_final = 
  brfss %>%
  filter((year == "2006" | year == "2010"),
        state == "NY")  %>%
  group_by(data_value) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = response,
             y = data_value, 
             fill = response)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_grid(. ~ year) +
  labs(x = "response",
       y = "data value",
       title = "Distribution of data value among locations in NY")

brfss_final

```

## Problem 3

First, I load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data, using `janitor::clean_names` to standardize variable names, adding a weekday vs weekend variable, and encoding the data with reasonable variable classes.

```{r accel}

accel = read_csv(file = "./hw3_data_files/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() 

accel_cleaned = 
  accel %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "activity_number",
    values_to = "activity_counts",
    names_prefix = "activity.") %>%
  mutate(
    weekend = (day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday"))

```

The dimensions of the new data set are `r dim(accel_cleaned)`. The variables are `r names(accel_cleaned)`. 

Next, I aggregate accross minutes to create a total activity variable for each day using `summarize`, then I create a table showing these totals.

```{r accel_total}

accel_total = 
  accel_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(day_id) %>% 
  summarize(total_activity_counts = sum(activity_counts))
knitr::kable(accel_total)

```

There are no major trends, and some days have much more activity than others. Occasionally, some have relatively little activity, such as days 2, 24, and 31. 

Finally, I make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. 

```{r accel_day, warning = FALSE}

accel_cleaned %>% 
  mutate(activity_numeric = as.numeric(activity_number)) %>%
  group_by(day, activity_numeric) %>%
  summarize(mean_activity = mean(activity_counts))  %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = activity_numeric, y = mean_activity, color = day)) + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "activity (hours)", y = "average activity counts", title = "Average 24-hour activity time course for days of the week", color = "day of the week") +
  scale_x_discrete(limit = c(0, 480, 960, 1440), 
                   labels = c("0", "8", "16", "24"))

ggsave("accel_spaghetti.pdf", width = 8, height = 5)

```

The graph does not indicate any specific pattern or trends in activity time courses other than that between 0 and 8 hours of activity, average activity counts are generally low, and they are higher for the rest of the 24-hour period for each day, with Friday and Sunday having noticeable peaks distint from the other 5 days.
